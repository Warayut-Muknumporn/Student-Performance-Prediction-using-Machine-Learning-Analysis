# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Analysis
In this dissertation, the project is based on machine learning algorithms
which are convenient for predicting student performance. One challenge of the research is dealing with the enormous amount of information in MOOCs. This research focuses on using educational data mining (EDM) to develop for the benefit of students and find the algorithm to predict student performance to predict the grade early and help students in terms of decision making.
